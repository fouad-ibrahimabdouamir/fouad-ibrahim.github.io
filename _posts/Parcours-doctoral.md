> _“A PhD is not just a degree — it’s a transformative journey of intellectual resilience.”_

Four years ago, I embarked on a research adventure at **Sultan Moulay Slimane University**. Today, I’d like to share the key milestones of this doctoral path, the unexpected challenges, and the insights I gathered along the way — with the hope that they might inspire or guide future researchers.

## 🔍 Choosing a Thesis Topic: Between Passion and Uncertainty

The title of my dissertation — _"Contribution to the Study of Fuzzy Fractional Differential Equations"_ — may sound intimidating, but it’s a perfect reflection of my academic curiosity.

Under the guidance of **Professor Mhamed El Omari**, I explored a rare intersection of three advanced fields:
- **Fractional calculus**
- **Differential equations**
- **Fuzzy logic**

Together, they allowed me to model complex systems under uncertainty, such as those found in biology, physics, or control theory.

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges: The Invisible Side of Research

Research in mathematics — especially when it straddles theory and application — demands more than just technical skills. Among the biggest challenges I faced:

- **Learning across multiple disciplines**: from functional analysis to fuzzy systems  
- **Building rigorous, publishable proofs** that hold up to international scrutiny  
- **Staying motivated**, even when weeks of effort led to a dead end  
- **Working in isolation**, especially during the early stages or the COVID era  

But every hurdle was also a source of personal and professional growth.

## 🌍 Publications and International Collaborations

Throughout my PhD, I had the chance to publish **over 11 peer-reviewed articles**, most of them indexed in major databases.

What made a real difference was **international collaboration**. Working with researchers from **Pakistan and Serbia** opened my eyes to new mathematical techniques, improved my writing, and taught me how to communicate ideas across cultures and time zones.

## 🎓 Advice to Future PhD Students

Here are a few takeaways I wish I had known at the beginning:

1. **Choose the right advisor** — not just based on reputation, but shared vision and mutual trust  
2. **Don't isolate yourself** — reach out to researchers abroad, attend conferences, stay visible  
3. **Publish often** — not just for the CV, but to clarify and refine your own thinking  
4. **Balance is key** — teaching while researching helped me reinforce my understanding and improve time management  

> _A PhD is not a sprint, nor a marathon — it’s an expedition. Equip yourself wisely._
