### Abstract
This in-depth study focuses on the analysis of nonlinear fuzzy hybrid fractional difference equations of Caputo-Nabla type of order ν ∈ [0,1]. Building upon previous work by Ardjouni et al. [4] and Mesmouli and Ardjouni [5], we employ Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem [1] to establish sufficient conditions for solution existence. Furthermore, we prove solution uniqueness using the contraction mapping principle [2], strengthening our results. A comprehensive stability and asymptotic stability analysis is conducted, providing valuable insights into long-term system behavior [3]. A concrete example is presented to support our main conclusions.

### Keywords
