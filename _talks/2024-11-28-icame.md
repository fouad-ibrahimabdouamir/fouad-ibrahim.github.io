## Presentation Overview

This work introduces novel analytical methods for solving fuzzy fractional differential equations by combining:

1. **Fuzzy conformable derivatives** with generalized Hukuhara differentiability
2. **α-semigroup theory** for solution construction
3. **Fixed-point theorems** for existence/uniqueness proofs

## Key Contributions

- New theoretical framework for fuzzy fractional operators
- Stability analysis of solutions under uncertainty
- Applications to:
  - Complex dynamical systems
  - Engineering systems with variable parameters
  - Biological systems modeling

## Mathematical Framework

The system considers equations of the form:

```math
D^{α}_FΨ(τ) = AΨ(τ) ⊕ Φ(τ,Ψ(τ))
